This specification defines how to secure Verifiable Credentials with JSON
Web Tokens (JWT) [RFC7519], which build on JSON Web Signatures (JWS)
[RFC7515]. This enables Verifiable Credentials to be easily integrated into ecosystems that already support JSON Web Tokens.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        JSON Web Token (JWT) [[RFC7519]] is a widely-used means of
        expressing
        <a data-cite="VC-DATA-MODEL#claims">claims</a> to be transferred between two parties. Providing a
        representation of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model for JWT allows
        existing systems and libraries to participate in the ecosystem described
        in Section <a data-cite="VC-DATA-MODEL#ecosystem-overview">ecosystem overview</a>. A JWT encodes a set of
        <a data-cite="VC-DATA-MODEL#claims">claims</a> as a JSON object that is contained in a JSON Web Signature
        (JWS) [[RFC7515]] and/or JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [[?RFC7516]]. For this specification, the use
        of JWE is out of scope.

        <h5>Verifiable Credentials Data Model</h5>
        <p>
          This specification describes how to secure media types 
          expressing Verifiable Credentials and Verifiable Presentations 
          as described in the [[VC-DATA-MODEL]], using JWTs [[RFC7519]].
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The <code>application/vc+jwt</code> media type described in this specification defines
          an example of a unidirectional mapping to a base media type defined in 
          the [[VC-DATA-MODEL]]; see <a href="#example-mapping">Appendix A.4.1</a>.

        how to use content types and token types to distinguish different representations of verifiable credentials.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        This representation relies on claims registered in the

      <h2>Securing the Core VC Data Model</h2>
      <p>
        The use of Verifiable Credentials often involves the representation and exchange of structured 
        data in the form of JSON-LD as this is the format of the core data model. While JSON-LD provides a flexible and extensible format for 
        describing data, it is important to note that it also provides a linkage between the data structure
        and semantic meaning of data. 
        </p>
        <p>
        This section outlines how JSON-LD encoded claimset can be secured using either JOSE or COSE.
      </p>
      <p>
                A benefit to this approach is that payloads can be made to conform directly to the [[VC-DATA-MODEL]]
        without any mapping or transformation.

  <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    Verifiable Credentials often contain sensitive information that needs to be protected 
    to ensure the privacy and security of organizations and individuals. This section outlines some privacy 
    considerations relevant to implementers and users.
  </p>
  <p>
    Implementers are advised to note and abide by all privacy considerations called out in the [[VC-DATA-MODEL]].
  </p>
  <p>
Implementers are additionally advised to reference the
<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-12">Privacy Consideration</a>
section of the JWT specification for privacy guidance.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the privacy recommendations in the [[VC-DATA-MODEL]], the following
    considerations are given:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Minimization of data: It is considered best practice for Verifiable Credentials to only contain the minimum amount 
          of data necessary to achieve their intended purpose. This helps to limit the amount 
          of sensitive information that is shared or stored unnecessarily.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Informed consent: It is considered best practice that individuals be fully informed about how their data will be 
          used and provide the ability to consent to or decline the use of their data. 
          This helps to ensure that individuals maintain control over their own personal information.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Data protection: It is considered best practice to protect Verifiable Credentials using strong encryption and other
          security measures to prevent unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. 
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    These considerations are not exhaustive, and implementers and users are advised to consult additional privacy 
    resources and best practices to ensure the privacy and security of Verifiable Credentials implemented
    using VC-JWT.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    This section outlines security considerations for implementers and 
    users of this specification.
    It is important to carefully consider these factors to ensure the security 
    and integrity of Verifiable Credentials when implemented using JWTs.
  </p>
  <p>
    When implementing VC-JWTs, it is essential to address all security issues relevant 
    to broad cryptographic applications. This especially includes protecting the user's
    asymmetric private and symmetric secret keys, as well as employing countermeasures 
    against various attacks. Failure to adequately address these issues could compromise 
    the security and integrity of Verifiable Credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized 
    access, modification, or disclosure of sensitive information. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Implementers are advised to follow best practices and established cryptographic standards to ensure 
    the secure handling of keys and other sensitive data. 
    Additionally, conduct regular security assessments and audits to identify and 
    address any vulnerabilities or threats.
  </p>
  <p>
    Follow all security considerations outlined in [[rfc7515]] and [[rfc7519]].
  </p>
  <p>
    When utilizing JSON-LD, take special care around remote retrieval of contexts and follow the
    additional security considerations noted in [[json-ld11]].
  </p>
  <p>
    As noted in [[rfc7515]] when utilizing JSON [[rfc7159]], strict validation is a security
    requirement. If malformed JSON is received, it may be impossible to reliably interpret the 
    producer's intent, potentially leading to ambiguous or exploitable situations.
    To prevent these risks, it is essential to use a JSON parser that strictly validates the syntax 
    of all input data. It is essential that any JSON inputs that do not conform to the JSON-text syntax defined in [[rfc7159]]
    be rejected in their entirety by JSON parsers. Failure to reject invalid input could compromise 
    the security and integrity of Verifiable Credentials.
  </p>
</section>
<section class="informative">
  <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    When implementing the VC-JWT specification, it is crucial for
    technical implementers to consider various accessibility factors.
    Ignoring accessibility concerns renders the information unusable for
    a significant portion of the population. To ensure equal access for
    all individuals, regardless of their abilities, it is vital to
    adhere to accessibility guidelines and standards, such as the Web
    Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) [[WCAG21]]. This becomes
    even more critical when establishing systems that involve
    cryptography, as they have historically posed challenges for
    assistive technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Implementers are advised to note and abide by all accessibility
    considerations called out in the [[VC-DATA-MODEL]].
  </p>
</section>


<section class="informative">
  <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    Implementers should take into account several
    internationalization considerations when publishing data described
    in this specification. Disregarding internationalization hampers the
    production and consumption of data across diverse languages and
    societies, thereby restricting the applicability and significantly
    reducing the value of the specification as a standard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Implementers are advised to note and abide by all
    internationalization considerations called out in the
    [[VC-DATA-MODEL]], see also <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/i18n">i18n</a>, <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org" />URL Standard<a/>

  <h2>Appendix</h2>
  <section>
    <h2>Example Mapping</h2>
    <p>
The following describes a mapping from <code>application/vc+jwt</code> to
<code>application/vc+ld+json</code>. This is one possible unidirectional mapping
between 2.0 VC-JWTs and the VC Data Model; other such mappings are possible.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
Extract <code>iss</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>iat</code>, <code>nbf</code>,
<code>exp</code>, <code>jti</code>, and <code>aud</code> as registered claims.
      </li>
      <li>
Set aside all other claims as subject claims.
      </li>
      <li>
To construct the VCDM-compliant JSON:
        <ul>
          <li>
Set the value of <code>@context</code> to
<code>"https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2"</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
Set the value of <code>type</code> to <code>["VerifiableCredential"]</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
Set the value of the <code>issuer</code> property to one of the following:
          <ul>
            <li>
If the value of <code>iss</code> is a URL, use the value of <code>iss</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
If the value of <code>iss</code> is not a URL, use the concatenation of "<code>urn:vc:</code>"
and the value of <code>iss</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
If <code>jti</code> is present, set the value of <code>id</code> to the
concatenation of "<code>urn:vc:</code>" and the value of <code>jti</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
If <code>nbf</code> is present, set the value of <code>validFrom</code> to the
<code>dateTime</code> obtained by converting the value of <code>nbf</code> from
the <code>NumericDate</code> described in [[!RFC7519]] to a <code>dateTime</code> as
described in [[XMLSCHEMA11-2]].
          </li>
          <li>
If <code>exp</code> is present, set the value of <code>validUntil</code> to the
<code>dateTime</code> obtained by converting the value of <code>exp</code> from
the <code>NumericDate</code> described in [[!RFC7519]] to a <code>dateTime</code> as
described in [[XMLSCHEMA11-2]].
          </li>
          <li>
Set the value of <code>credentialSubject</code> to an object that contains
the following properties:
          <ul>
            <li>
If <code>sub</code> is present, set the value of the <code>id</code> property to
the concatenation of "urn:vc:" and the value of <code>sub</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
Add all of the subject claims.
            </li>
          </ul>


          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
